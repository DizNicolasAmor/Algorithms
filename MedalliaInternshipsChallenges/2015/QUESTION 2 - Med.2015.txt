Question 2

In how many different ways can the letters of the word 'DETAIL'
be arranged in such a way that the vowels occupy only the odd positions?

32
48
36
60
120

Answer: 36

Explanation:
The constrain is the position of the vowels. So,

All diff ways = All posibilities vowels can be arranged * All posibilities consonants can be arranged

It is a permutation problem, beacuse
-there are no repetitions
-order of the elements does matter
-number of elements are equal to number of positions.
( DETAIL has 3 odd positions for 3 vowels and 3 even positions for 3 consonants).

So,
All diff ways = 3! * 3! = 6*6 = 36

Question 1

The sum of the present ages of a father and his son is 60 years.
Six years ago, father's age was five times the age of the son.
After 6 years, son's age will be:

12 years
14 years
18 years
20 years

Present:	Son: 14, Father: 46
Father + Son = 60
Father = 60 - Son

Past: (six years ago)	Son: 8, Father: 40
Father - 6 = (Son – 6 ) *5
Father = (Son – 6 ) *5 + 6
60 – Son = 5 Son – 30 + 6
6 Son = 84
Son = 14

Future: (6 years later)	Son: 20, Father: 52

Answer
After 6 years, son's age will be: 20 years

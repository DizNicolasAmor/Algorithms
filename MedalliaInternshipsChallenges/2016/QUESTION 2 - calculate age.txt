QUESTION 2

Q, R & T

Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. 
If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years, 
what is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?

1year

2 years

25 years

Data inadequate

None of these


ANSWER

First pose the data: 
	T < Q < R

	Q + X = R 
	T + X = Q -> T = Q - X

Then, find Q's age:
   R     + T     = 50
   Q + X + Q - X = 50
   Q = 25

Then find R's age: 
	-> I know that R has more than 25 years beacuse he is older than Q. 
	-> Besides, he has less than 51 years, because R + T = 50.
So: 
	26 < R < 50 
The question is the difference between R and Q's age.
	1 < R - Q < 25

There are 25 possibilities. And the data is inadequate. 

FINAL ANSWER: DATA INADEQUATE

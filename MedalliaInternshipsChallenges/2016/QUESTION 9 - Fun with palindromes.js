/* QUESTION 9 - Fun with palindromes

Problem Statement
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same forward
and backwards. For example: "madam" and "dad" are palindromes, but "sir" and "sad" are not.
The fun score for two subsequences (not substrings), A and B, in string s is the product of their
respective lengths. There are many ways to choose A and B, but your goal is to maximize the fun
score. There can't be any overlap or crossover between the two subsequences.
Given string s, select exactly two non-overlapping noncrossing-over palindromic subsequences , A and B,
from s to maximize the fun score.
Non crossing over means that given the string aababb , you can't get aaa and bbb, since the subsequences cross over.

Constraints
1 < |s| â‰¤ 3000
s is composed of lowercase English characters.

Input Format
Complete a function named funPal which takes a single string (s) as a parameter.
Output Format
Return a single integer denoting the maximum possible fun score for s.

Sample Input 0
acdapmpomp
Sample Output 0
15

Sample Input 1
axbawbaseksqke
Sample Output 1
25

Explanation
Sample Case 0
You can select A= aca and B= pmpmp . The product is 3 * 5 = 15, so we return 15.
Sample Case 1
You can select A= ababa and B= ekske . 
The product is 5 * 5 = 25, so we print 25. Another possible solution
is A= ababa and B= ekqke which also yields the answer 25.

/* My reasoning 
In order to find a palindrome in a str, I know that: 
-> first char and last char are equal. 
-> if there are more char between them, first char +1 == last char -1. 
-> and so on. 
With this criterion I built the auxiliar function countPal(str); 

In order to find the two bigest subsequences: 
-> I go through each char of the array and I count the palindromes that can be formed from this char. 
-> Then, I push () this count in an array named <subsequences>;
-> If inside the last palindrome there is a char that is the beggining of a bigger palindrome, I replace this palindrome. (so there is non-overlapping). 
-> Finally, with subsequences.sort() I know that the two bigest non-overlapping subsequences (A and B) are at the end. 
->Multiply A and B and that is the max score.

(without taking the order into account)? 

159
194
205
209


ANSWER

It is a combination problem, beacuse the order of the elements does not matter. 
The formula is this: C(k, n) =  n! / k! (n - k)!

My approach: 
I will calculate all the possible ways to select 4 children from a group of 10 and then 
I will subtract those ways in which the group is constituted only by girls. 

	Answer = AllDifferentWays - GroupOfGirlsOnly

And I know that GroupOfGirlsOnly = 1 because there are only 4 girls. 

So, replace the values: 
	Answer = AllDifferentWays - GroupOfGirlsOnly
	Answer = 10! / 4! 6!    -   1
	Answer = 10*9*8*7*6! / 4*3*2*6!   -   1
	Answer = = 10*3*7 = 30*7   -   1
	Answer = 210 - 1
	Answer = 209

	Final Answer = 209

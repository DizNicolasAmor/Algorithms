QUESTION 1

A rectangular field is to be fenced. 
The north side is 20 meters long 
and the area of the field is 680 squared meters. 
How many meters of fencing will be required, if we were to fence all but the north side? 

34
68
88
108

SOLUTION 

ANSWER = Perimeter - northSide

This is the formula to calculate the Perimeter: 
	Perimeter = 2(width + heigth)

I already know that width = northSide = 20m.
So, I must calculate the height: 

	Area = width * height 
	680 m^2 = 20m * height
	heigth = 68m/2 = 34m

Now I calculate the Perimeter: 

	Perimeter = 2 (20m + 34m) = 2 * 54m = 108m


Back to top: 

ANSWER = Perimeter - northSide
ANSWER = 108m - 20m
ANSWER = 88m

FINAL ANSWER: 88
